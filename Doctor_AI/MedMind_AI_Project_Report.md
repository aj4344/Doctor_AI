## Abstract

MedMind AI is an innovative multimodal artificial intelligence platform that revolutionizes preliminary health consultations by combining computer vision, natural language processing, and speech technologies. The system enables users to describe their symptoms through voice input while simultaneously uploading medical images for comprehensive analysis. 

The platform leverages advanced AI models including Meta's Llama-4-Scout for image analysis, Groq's Whisper for speech-to-text conversion, and Edge TTS for generating natural doctor-like voice responses. Built using Gradio for the user interface and deployed on Hugging Face Spaces, the system provides globally accessible healthcare assistance.

Key achievements include successful integration of multimodal AI technologies, real-time voice processing, professional medical image analysis, and deployment on cloud platforms for worldwide accessibility. The system demonstrates significant potential in bridging healthcare gaps and providing preliminary medical guidance, particularly in underserved areas.
